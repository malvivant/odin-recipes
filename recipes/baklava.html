    (or filo) dough, nuts, spices, and a sugary honey syrup.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>1 pound chopped nuts</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). <br>
        Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13 inch pan.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. Unroll phyllo dough. <br>
        Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth <br>
        to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, <br>
        butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered. Sprinkle <br>
        2 - 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, <br>
        nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 - 8 sheets deep.</li>
<br>
    <li>Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the <br>
        bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows the make diagonal cuts. <br>
        Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.</li>
<br>
    <li>Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar <br>
        is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
<br>
    <li>Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. <br>
        Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets <br>
        soggy if it is wrapped up.</li>
